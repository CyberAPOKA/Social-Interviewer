You can download the project or use the command ``` git clone https://github.com/CyberAPOKA/Social-Interviewer ```,
in this repository in particular I left the .env in the project, because there is a configuration to send emails.
create a bank named socialinterviewer and open the project in your editor and type the following commands in the terminal, 
``` composer install ```, ``` php artisan migrate --seed ``` and then ``` php artisan serve ```, the project is already running in local environment ``` 127.0.0.1:8000 ```. it is important to use --seed, because there is a configuration for the beginning and end of the selection process, and this configuration is passed on to the seed.<br>
